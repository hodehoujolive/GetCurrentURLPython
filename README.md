# Selenium with Python Tutorial: How to Get Current URL with Python

This test automation project demonstrates the use of pytest and Selenium to build a robust and scalable testing framework. The project focuses on showcasing the utilization of Selenium's `current_url` function to retrieve the current URL of a website.

## Key Points

- **pytest Integration:** The project leverages pytest, a powerful testing framework for Python, to organize and execute test cases efficiently. pytest offers a wide range of features, such as test discovery, fixtures, and assertions, enabling testers to build reliable and maintainable test suites.

- **Selenium Integration:** Selenium, a popular web automation framework, is seamlessly integrated into the project. With Selenium, testers can automate browser interactions, perform end-to-end testing, and validate web applications across different browsers and platforms.

- **Retrieving Current URL:** The project demonstrates the use of Selenium's `current_url` function to retrieve the URL of the current webpage. This functionality is particularly useful for verifying proper navigation and flow within the website during test execution.

- **Test Case Examples:** The project provides test case examples that showcase the effective use of `current_url`. These examples cover scenarios such as validating URL redirects, confirming successful form submissions, and verifying the correct landing page after login.
